# awesome-props.ts

A dive into TypeScript + React with an introduction to client-side JWT authentication and some practice with React.componentWillReceiveProps.

The app interfaces with the [AwesomeDotNet](https://github.com/mjosc/AwesomeDotNet) API which connects to a MySQL database with a very simple LMS-type schema.

Check out src/components/App.tsx for a look at a very raw implementation of client-side JWT authentication.

src/components/Users and src/components/Courses take on two different designs. Courses.tsx implements a basic example of componentWillReceiveProps.

Take a look at pretty much anything to see some TypeScript.

This app was initialized with create-react-app with TypeScript as described in [this GitHub repo](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript-React-Starter) by Microsoft.
